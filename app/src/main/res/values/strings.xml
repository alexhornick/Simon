    <string name="about_text">This Simon game comes with 3 versions of the game. The first version,
        you simply repeat the pattern Simon follows. The last version will have multiple repeats of
        each button and it\'s up to you to keep track. The third version will slowly speed up how fast
        Simon does the patterns. Enjoy the game!\n\nPiano sounds created by user Jobro on freesound.org under
